# guessing-game
This is my first python experience. The example came from the "Introduction to Python" course on Coursera.

In this game, a random number generator would randomly generate a number between 1 to 100. A player and the computer would guess the number. Once a player guesses it, the computer will share how many tries it takes the player and the computer to guess the number.
